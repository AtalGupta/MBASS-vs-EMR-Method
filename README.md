# MBASS-vs-EMR-Method
The aim of the 'MBASS vs EMR for Completeness Magnitude in Indian catalogue' project
was to compare the effectiveness of two widely used methods for determining the
completeness magnitude (Mc) of earthquake catalogues in the Indian region. The two
methods that were compared were the Median Based Analysis of the Segment Slope
(MBASS) method and the Entire Magnitude Range (EMR) method. The Indian earthquake
catalogue was used as the dataset for the project, which contains a large amount of data that
can be used to assess the seismicity of the region. The MBASS method involves analyzing
the slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) of earthquakes in a catalogue to
determine Mc. On the other hand, the EMR method involves comparing the observed FMD
of earthquakes to the theoretical FMD expected for a complete earthquake catalogue. The
results of the project showed that both the MBASS and EMR methods provided consistent
and reliable Mc estimates for the Indian earthquake catalogue. The MBASS method
identified Mc to be around 3.8 , while the EMR method estimated it to be between 3.4 and
3.7. The consistency between the two methods highlights the reliability of the Indian
earthquake catalogue. The study provides valuable insights into the applicability of the
MBASS and EMR methods for assessing Mc in other earthquake catalogues. The findings
suggest that both methods can be used as complementary tools for assessing the completeness
magnitude of earthquake catalogues. The results of the project have important implications
for seismic hazard analysis and earthquake prediction in the Indian region. Accurate and
reliable assessments of Mc are crucial for understanding the seismicity of a region and for
estimating the potential maximum earthquake magnitude that could occur in the future.
